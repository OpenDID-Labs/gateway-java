Web2 Gateway is centralized software that users can install in their local environments to interact with OpenDID through Web2 protocols.

Currently, we provide a Java version of Web2 Gateway. When you send a verification request to OpenDID through `opendid-gateway-java` , you need to pay for the APT on the APTOS mainnet. Therefore, you need to prepare an APTOS wallet and recharge enough APT on the mainnet to ensure that OpenDID can handle your verification request normally.

See the  [Deployment Manual](https://github.com/OpenDID-Labs/gateway-java/blob/main/Deployment%20Manual.md) for running your own gateway in a production environment.
